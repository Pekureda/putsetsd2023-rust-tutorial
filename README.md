# Rust tutorial

Recommended IDE: VS Code + `rust-analyzer` (rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension

How to get Rust:
1. Recommended way: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Docker image: Use VS Code and connect to the Docker instance -> run `docker compose up`. Install extensions to VS Code such as Docker (ms-azuretools.vscode-docker). If your Docker image is up then please connect to the container with VS code. It is highly recommended that you'll install `rust-analyzer` extension (rust-lang.rust-analyzer). Then open each task directory in VS Code. Otherwise `rust-analyzer` will not work.
